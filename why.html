<p>The purpose of data science is broadly to bring together, in a rigorous way, all
that goes into doing good things with data—for learning from data and for
building things with data to put those learnings to use, for example, in
safeguarding public health. CDC consumes a lot of data to support its public
health mission. Traditional sources include surveillance, vital records,
surveys, program evaluation, studies of health services, and clinical trials.
More recent sources include billing and claims data, electronic health records,
social media, and sensor data. From small, structured data to high-volume,
unstructured data, over time the scope and scale of those data expand and become
more complex.</p>
<p>Why should we focus on data science? Because we need to keep up with rapidly
changing methods, tools, and technology for extracting meaning from data.</p>
<p>Data science makes available tools for classic problems, such as working with
data through the life cycle from problem formulation to collection to data
management, through analysis, interpretation, and presentation. Contemporary
issues in data science arise from movements to be open and to expand the scale
of data and sophistication of analytic methods. Making data available for wide
audiences, while ensuring adequate protections of individual privacy. Describing
practices to make analyses reproducible, or at least traceable. Working with
high-volume data, such as genomics, and high-velocity, real-time data, as found
in syndromic surveillance and claims data feeds. And making sense out of
unstructured text, images, and other nontraditional data types. Most
contemporary problems differ from classic problems in scale rather than kind.
For example, whether administrative data come from paper-based registers in
resource-constrained settings or from massive stores of insurance claims data,
they pose the same problems for inferring causes. Data science promotes
principled use of the full breadth of methods, from the familiar to the
unfamiliar, along with the norms to ensure that methods and results stand up to
scrutiny. Data science crosses disciplines.</p>
<p>There’s another reason to focus on data science: Data science affords a measure
of autonomy for practicing and honing data skills, because of ready access to
open methods, tools, and technology. Some technical skills require special
equipment (like growth media or microscopes in a microbiology laboratory) or
access to humans (like clinical medicine or behavioral counseling). In contrast,
to learn about data and from data, it is often enough to have data in hand,
widely available software, and the persistence to jump into a problem and break
it open. Software is now often freely available, with growing contributions by
the very active R and Python user communities. So data science can be practiced
with a great deal of self-determination. With that autonomy comes the latitude
to own and direct one’s learning. Thus, the enterprising scientist can
capitalize on that autonomy in order to keep up with fast-moving methods, tools,
and technology, in part by continuing to learn how to learn from data. This
autonomy presents a paradox that we will try to resolve later (in section <a href="who.html#staff-organized">5.4.2</a>): Data science is necessarily interdisciplinary, and not every
practitioner needs to cross all the disciplines. So how can one be autonomous
and team-oriented at the same time?</p>
<p>In summary, we focus on data science because we want to learn from data, learn
about data, and learn with data.</p>
<p><strong>Learning <em>from</em> data</strong>: Data have value because data help us learn things
about the world. What we learn helps us to make informed choices about how we
interact with the world, for example, through public health interventions.</p>
<p><strong>Learning <em>about</em> data</strong>: Data come in many structures, sizes, shapes, and
speeds, from small, flat data tables to massive, unstructured data streams. Data
conform to a variety of standards, or no standards at all. The varied
characteristics of data both enrich and constrain the ways that data reveal
characteristics of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Learning <em>with</em> data</strong> through its full life cycle: Analytic knowledge and
skills allow us to pose rich questions about the world, amenable to rich
methods; guide how we generate, transmit, obtain, and prepare data; probe data
to answer questions about the world; place answers from data in context, mindful
of assumptions and alternatives; present data-driven answers to audiences
clearly and correctly; and preserve those answers and ensure that the entire
life cycle is transparent, accessible, traceable and, to the extent possible,
reproducible.</p>
<p>The field of data science addresses a wide variety of problems (what), and the
practice of data science straddles autonomous and collaborative styles (how).
Thus, we also focus on data science so that we can build and sustain a culture
(who) for doing good things with data, for continuously learning things about
the world, and for empowering choices informed by those learnings, and for being
ever-ready to learn from and act on data.</p>
