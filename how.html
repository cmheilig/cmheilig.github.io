<p>If we think of data as an asset, how does that asset produce value
within our mission and our available resources? How can public health
scientists who care about data keep up with fast-moving methods, tools,
and technology for learning from data? A progressive culture
intentionally orients itself proactively and not only reactively, toward
advancement and not just tradition. While a progressive culture
encourages innovation, more importantly this community continually
expands the set of tools for doing good things with data and applies
judgment for selecting among familiar or conventional options as well as
unfamiliar or unconventional options. A progressive culture for data
remains rooted in history, continues to learn from old data in new ways,
anticipates the future, and handles evolving demands to keep up with
fast-moving methods, tools, and technology.</p>
<p>Here I sketch a vision for fostering the practice of data science across
disciplines and levels of experience by describing 3 components of a
progressive culture for data:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>developing know-how through data-savvy <strong>technical skills</strong> to
bridge domain knowledge and methods for learning from data,</p></li>
<li><p>cultivating data-wise <strong>nontechnical skills</strong> to drive
problem-solving with data (start inquiry, keep it on track, and deal
with obstacles), and</p></li>
<li><p>participating in an empowering <strong>community</strong> of mentors and peers to
enable self-learning and foster practical wisdom.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After describing technical and nontechnical skills, I map those skills
to an expanded treatment of Peng and Matsui’s core activities of data
science. Then I sketch functions and roles in an empowering community.
In the next section, on <em>who</em> does data science, I more fully articulate
those functions and roles along with the level of technical and
nontechnical skill needed for each.</p>
</div>
<div id="technical-skills" class="section level2" number="4.2">
<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Foster technical skills<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#technical-skills"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>What skills are required to practice data science rigorously? What about
those who want or need to practice data science well but who don’t need
to be expert data scientists? The core activities of data science call
for knowing how to pose a good question, how to compile and prepare the
data to answer the question, and how to extract, interpret, and convey
meaning from the data in answer to the question. Data science skills are
often represented (for example, by <span class="citation">NIST Big Data Public Working Group (<a href="#ref-nist_big_data_public_working_group_nist_2015">2015</a>)</span>) as the cross-disciplinary
intersection of 3 sets of technical skills that cover these core
activities: domain-specific skills for posing a good question and
interpreting and explaining results; computational skills for
corralling, structuring, and applying algorithms to data; and
data-analytic skills, including communication skills, for extracting,
interpreting, and conveying meaning from data.</p>
<p><strong>Domain-specific skills</strong> cover any subject about which one might want
to use data to answer a question, including public health, epidemiology,
medicine, microbiology, toxicology, and anthropology. In practice,
different fields often call for different norms for rigor. Epidemiology
establishes modes to reason about bias and causation. Medicine
institutes norms for assessing preventive and therapeutic efficacy and
effectiveness. Microbiology and toxicology work out how to establish and
measure the presence of a pathogen or toxin for ascertaining individual
cases.</p>
<p><strong>Computational skills</strong> cover how to use theory, hardware, and software
to represent and work with data of various structures, sizes, shapes,
and speeds, to enable transmission and exchange of data and other
information among systems and among users, to implement algorithms for
working with and analyzing data, and to manage the efficiency of all of
these undertakings. How should textual information, audiovisual
information, and other types of information be represented for further
computational access and use? Having obtained and stored various types
of information, how should they be processed and arranged in preparation
for analysis? How can algorithms for working with data make the best use
of available computational resources, such as memory and processing
time? How can algorithms be implemented to work with increasing volumes,
speed, and complexity of data while ensuring that computational results
are available in an acceptable amount of time and other limitations?
Computational skills cover or overlap programming, data-wrangling,
software engineering, statistical computing, and methods for breaking up
high-volume, high-velocity, or otherwise intensive data problems into
smaller pieces, processing them, and reassembling the output.</p>
<p><strong>Data-analytic skills</strong>, as discussed above, encompass statistical
methods, machine learning, and other modes of data analysis. Statistical
modeling typically refers to using probability to think about how data
might have been generated and then using data to figure out how we might
separate a representation of something about the world (signal) from
variability or uncertainty about that representation (noise).
Statistical methods include simple summaries like means and medians and
more complicated summaries like tables, regression models, and
time-to-event models. Machine learning typically refers to asking
whether we can find patterns within a set of data, like clusters of
similar counties or patients or topics in a set of documents, or
patterns that relate inputs to outputs based on examples, such as for
predicting a patient’s disease status or prognosis from available
insurance claims and billing information. Other data-analytic approaches
include causal, geospatial, and econometric methods. These methods often
overlap, and they often incorporate but don’t always center on
probability components.</p>
<p>I include <strong>communication skills</strong> primarily with data-analytic skills,
because an analyst often has primary responsibility for interpreting,
representing, and conveying methods and results. These skills include
the ability to use verbal narrative, tables, and graphics to explore,
develop, and tell a story that translates results into stories,
decisions, and actions.</p>
<p>While data science is often represented at the 3-way intersection of
domain-specific, computational, and data-analytic skills, it is also
instructive to review their pairwise overlap. The combination of
domain-specific and computational skills could encompass domain-specific
software development, as with medical or laboratory applications.
Domain-specific and data-analytic skills entail applied research, as in
epidemiological applications. And computational and data-analytic skills
overlap in statistical computing, machine learning, and other
applications that implement mathematical algorithms and optimization.</p>
<p>We can roughly associate each core activity in data science with
technical skill areas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pose good questions</strong>. Domain knowledge is needed to state and
refine a good question. An awareness and understanding of a broad and
rich variety of data-analytic methods can also enhance the kinds of
questions that one could pose.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare data to address those questions</strong>. Domain knowledge informs
what to measure or assess, and computational skills inform how to
obtain, organize, store, transmit, extract, and transform data.
Data-analytic skills support assessments of whether the data can
answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Probe the data</strong> through rigorous analysis. Building a formal model
depends primarily on data-analytic skills, supported by strong
computational skills for implementing the analysis, especially when
working with complex data or methods.</p>
<p><strong>Place analytic results in context</strong>. Interpreting models depends on
the data-analytic skills to construct them and to critique
model-related assumptions, as well as domain knowledge to place the
results in context of what is already known or perceived about the
domain subject.</p>
<p><strong>Present methods and results</strong>. Communication draws on data-analytic
skills for correctly describing methods and formal results, as well as
domain knowledge for correctly describing and relating to
subject-matter.</p>
<p><strong>Preserve the entire life cycle</strong>. Predominantly, computational
skills support procedures for openness and traceability, including
preparation of data and code for restricted or unrestricted sharing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, it is very likely that every core activity will draw on all 3
types of technical skills.</p>

</h2>
<p>To practice data science well and to keep up with constant change, it is
not enough to focus on technical skills and knowledge. Technical skills
cover the know-how for answering good scientific questions rigorously
using data, but technical skills have limits and can become obsolete as
methods, tools, and technology advance.</p>
<p>Nontechnical skills (sometimes called “soft skills”) are personality
traits, goals, motivations, and preferences that are valued in an
applied domain. For example, collaboration and communication call for
interpersonal skills. In addition, many sources (such as <span class="citation">Davenport and Patil (<a href="#ref-davenport_data_2012">2012</a>)</span>) emphasize that those who practice data science should be
passionate, curious problem-solvers. Here I pay special attention to
traits that support, and even empower, learning from data through its
life cycle, centered on analysis and subject to scientific norms. In
other words, I describe and unpack the traits that flow from a love of
knowledge and learning, followed by traits that support the ethical
conduct of data science.</p>
<div id="intellectual-character" class="section level3" number="4.3.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> Intellectual character<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#intellectual-character"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>In a progressive culture for data, fostering intellectual character can
cultivate responsible learners and inquirers who are better able to keep
up with fast-moving methods, tools, and technology. Intellectual virtues
flow from a love of knowledge and learning, aiming at “cognitive goods”,
like truth and understanding <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-king_what_2014">King 2014</a>; see also <a href="#ref-costa_describing_2008">Costa and Kallick 2008</a>)</span>. In data
science, the practitioner seeks understanding mediated through data and
the life cycle of data. Intellectual virtues animate scientific practice
in general and data science in particular. This subsection draws heavily
on the work of Jason Baehr, especially Baehr <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baehr_cognitive_2013">Baehr 2013a</a>; <a href="#ref-baehr_educating_2013">Baehr 2013b</a>; <a href="#ref-baehr_cultivating_2015">Baehr 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_cultivating_2015">2015</a>)</span> describes 3 dimensions of an intellectual virtue: First, an
<strong>ability or skill</strong> specific to a virtue and leading to action. For the
trait of curiosity, this skill is asking good questions. Second, the
<strong>motivation or commitment</strong> to apply the virtue. With curiosity, the
motivation is to ask good questions because of a love of knowledge or
learning. Third, the <strong>judgment or sensitivity</strong> to know when and how to
exercise virtuous abilities or skills. With curiosity, the sensitivity
concerns when to start, continue, pause, or stop inquiry. In addition,
each virtue can be seen as the mean between vices—too little of a good
thing and too much of a good thing. Too little curiosity is the vice of
indifference, while too much curiosity is the vice of obsession or
fixation.</p>
<p>We can identify several intellectual virtues by examining the
dispositions associated with stages of inquiry when approaching an
objective: starting to learn and heading in the right direction, keeping
the inquiry on track, and dealing with obstacles. For each stage of
inquiry described below, I list stage-related virtues and use the pipe
character (“|”) to delimit each virtue’s corresponding ability or
skill, motivation or commitment, judgment or sensitivity, and vices
representing too much or too little of the virtue.</p>
<p><strong>Start learning and head in the right direction</strong>. A few intellectual
virtues relate to how to start learning or start an inquiry and ensure
that it heads in the right direction: In addition to curiosity,
intellectual autonomy is the ability to think for oneself, and
intellectual humility is the ability to admit one’s limitations—to
know what you don’t know.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Curiosity</strong>: Ask good questions | to learn | discerning when to
start, continue, pause, or stop the inquiry | mediating between
indifference and fixation.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual autonomy</strong>: Think for oneself | to achieve independent
thought or self-assuredness | discerning when to yield to others or
differentiate from others | mediating between conformity and
radicalism.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual humility</strong>: Admit one’s limitations | to recognize
what one is able or unable to do or to locate oneself in the context
of others’ interests | discerning when to assert oneself or to stand
back | mediating between arrogance and self-deprecation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Keep the learning process on track</strong>. After starting an inquiry, a few
intellectual virtues assist the learner in keeping on track:
Attentiveness is the ability to engage, to look and listen, and to
notice details. Carefulness is the ability to spot and avoid errors.
Thoroughness is the ability to go deep in order to gain understanding
and to explain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Intellectual attentiveness</strong>: Look and listen | to remain alert to
details | discerning when to tune out or to focus more intently |
mediating between distractedness and preoccupation.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual carefulness</strong>: Avoid errors | to assure or control the
quality of one’s output | discerning when to ease up or to double
down on quality control | mediating between sloppiness and
perfectionism.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual thoroughness</strong>: Go deep to understand | to ensure
sufficiently complete coverage or treatment | discerning when to fill
gaps or let well enough alone | mediating between superficiality and
meticulousness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Deal with obstacles</strong>. Even on track to learning, one is likely to
encounter obstacles. A learner benefits from intellectual virtues that
help work through or around obstacles: Open-mindedness helps to think
outside the box when confronted with a challenge to solve. Courage helps
to be bold and to take intellectual risks. Flexibility helps to adapt as
needed. Tenacity or perseverance helps to embrace struggle while working
through a challenge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Open-mindedness</strong>: Think outside the box | to consider new or
unfamiliar ideas and seek diversity and inclusion | discerning which
ideas to dismiss or to entertain an idea | mediating between
narrow-mindedness and gullibility.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual courage</strong>: Take intellectual risks | to allow for bold
action despite potential for failure | discerning when to tolerate
more or less potential for failure | mediating between cowardice and
foolhardiness.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual flexibility</strong>: Adapt as needed | to allow for change,
especially for improving outcomes | discerning when and how much to
stand firm or alter activity | mediating between intransigence and
suggestibility.</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual tenacity</strong>: Carry on | to continue toward learning
objective, even when challenged | discerning when to persist and when
to stop trying | mediating between fickleness and stubbornness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Intellectual virtues can conflict with each other. For example, courage
can conflict with humility when the drive to take an intellectual risk
runs counter to the limitations of one’s abilities (when one’s reach
exceeds one’s grasp). To navigate these conflicts, the good learner or
thinker is aided by the mediating virtue of <strong>practical wisdom</strong>. This
trait allows the inquirer (<em>phronimos</em>, per <span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_cognitive_2013">2013a</a>)</span>) to grasp which
intellectual activity is most valuable for attaining one’s goals. Recall
that <span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_cultivating_2015">2015</a>)</span> identifies one dimension of an intellectual virtue as
judgment or sensitivity about when and when not to exercise that virtue.
Practical wisdom undergirds this dimension and also allows the good
learner or thinker to take suitable action when intellectual virtues
conflict. (See <span class="citation">Turri et al. (<a href="#ref-turri_virtue_2021">2021</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_cognitive_2013">2013a</a>)</span>.)</p>
<p>Even if, as a good learner or thinker, you are motivated to apply
intellectual virtues, you still need to develop the abilities and
judgment that connect your motivation to right action. Intellectual
virtues are developed by practicing them and by critical reflection on
your own actions and dispositions. You get better at courage by
practicing courage—by taking intellectual risks and learning from the
consequences. You get better at humility by practicing humility—by
owning your limitations and not shying away from them. You also develop
or cultivate practical wisdom—to avoid vice and to mediate conflicting
virtues—through practice and guidance and seeing them modeled by
others. Curricula and other resources, including literature, computing
resources, and mentors, can help intentionally and systematically
cultivate intellectual virtues. I return to these ideas in the section
on learning data science in community.</p>
<p>Just as we associated each core activity with technical skills, we can
also associate the critical reflection process with nontechnical skills.
Setting expectations corresponds to starting learning and heading in the
right direction, which calls for curiosity, autonomy, and humility.
Collecting information and comparing expectations with that information
corresponds to keeping the learning process on track: attentiveness,
carefulness, and thoroughness. And dealing with matched or mismatched
expectations and information corresponds to dealing with obstacles:
open-mindedness, courage, flexibility, and tenacity.</p>

</h3>
<p>Where intellectual virtues connect a love of knowledge and learning to
the practice of asking and answering questions, ethics and values
promote behaviors to achieve other goods, including trust, equity, and
fairness.</p>
<p>We seek to protect personal privacy, and to balance privacy and utility,
with specific behaviors throughout the life cycle of data: posing
questions that do not raise undue risk to respondents; obtaining, using,
communicating about, and sharing data in ways to limit risks to privacy
and confidentiality; interpreting and communicating findings in ways
that respect other rights and the welfare of the subjects of analysis;
and promoting openness, transparency, and other aspects of data utility
to make the overall process, methods, and final products available for
scrutiny.</p>
<p>Further considerations concerning ethics and values in the practice of
data science stem from the conduct of research involving human subjects,
the conduct of public health surveillance, scientific integrity, and
public service. Many of these considerations pertain to data, data
systems and informatics, and data analysis. They go beyond privacy and
confidentiality to justifications for gathering information; for
balancing benefits and harms, burden and utility, access and security;
self-determination and substantive engagement; justice; duties to limit
collections and to use what is collected, and responsibility to avoid
fabricating, falsifying, and plagiarizing. These duties are covered
extensively elsewhere and are often implemented through regulation,
policy, checklists, and other forms of guidance. (See, for example,
CDC's <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/os/integrity/index.htm">Office of Public Health Ethics and
Regulations</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cdcprivacy/index.html">Privacy
Program</a>.)</p>
<p>In a progressive culture for data, we <em>value</em> data because data help us
learn to things about the world and to make informed choices about how
we interact with the world. We <em>value</em> innovation and technology insofar
as they help us to continue expanding the means for doing good things
with data, but we do not seek innovation or technology as ends in
themselves. An extensive set of tools gives us the broadest options for
doing good things, so we remain open both to the unfamiliar or
unconventional and the familiar or conventional. Based on these values,
we practice pragmatic, principled pluralism by exploring and using
wisely and well all methods that can help achieve technical excellence
to learn from, about, and with data. Principled pluralism allows honest
disagreement about methods, results, and interpretation.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> Foster community and leadership<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#foster-community-and-leadership"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Community and leadership form the essence of <em>culture</em> in a progressive
culture for data—so essential that I defer the full discussion to the
next section (<a href="who.html#who">5</a>). In this section, I sketch <em>how</em> community and leadership
enable the practice of data science along the following dimensions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Learning</strong>. Community supports learning about data, and learning how
to do data science, by centering on learners. Learning can follow
formal curricula and be encouraged in structured programs, but
substantial portions of learning occur in informal settings. Learners
benefit from interactions with peers and mentors. Mentors benefit from
meta-mentors. Advocates influence, guide, and support the
learning-oriented community.</p>
<p><strong>Doing</strong>. Community supports the practice and profession of data
science by giving everyone who wants to do good things with data the
resources to do so. Data science learner-practitioners with basic or
intermediate data skills come from any discipline to do good things
with data. Expert practitioners go deep on data science methods and
guide practitioners to proceed with rigor and stand behind their work.
Managers supervise practitioners and experts, to ensure that they have
the resources and direction that they need to achieve good things with
data. Lay advocates, as persons literate in the value of data, work in
community with practitioners, experts, and managers and help ensure
supportive resources to enable the practice of data science.</p>
<p><strong>Staffing</strong>. Community creates and ensures the capacity for data
science through staffing and career development by all available means
to recruit, retain, organize, and develop learners, doers, and
supporters. This includes identifying and building on the data science
potential among existing staff, finding and using mechanisms to bring
on learners as well as other federal and nonfederal staff, and
organizing formal and informal structures for staff to learn, do,
manage, and support data science effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Leading</strong>. In a progressive culture for data, leadership aims toward
and flows from practical wisdom. Leadership is part of the practice of
data science, and not separate from it. Leaders include practitioners,
experts, managers, and laypersons, regardless of their career stage,
job title or series, credential, or location in the hierarchy (subject
to some structural constraints in the federal system).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within and across these dimensions, an individual can carry out more
than one role or function. For example, in the <em>doing</em> dimension, a
practitioner can serve as both an expert and a manager. The same person
can also serve as meta-mentor and advocate in the <em>learning</em> dimension.
In the next section, I expand on the roles and functions that align with
these dimensions.</p>
