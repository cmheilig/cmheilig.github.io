<p>We have no shortage of definitions of “data science”, because different
definitions serve different purposes. I will start with a tautological
description that almost amounts to an operational definition.</p>
<div id="data-science-is-what-data-scientists-do" class="section level3" number="3.1.1">

<span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Data science is what data scientists do<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-science-is-what-data-scientists-do"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Writing in 2012 for the <em>Harvard Business Review</em>, Tom Davenport and DJ Patil
(the US Chief Data Scientist during the Obama Administration) wrote the
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[W]hat data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data. … At
ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large
quantities of formless data and make analysis possible. They identify rich
data sources, join them with other, potentially incomplete data sources, and
clean the resulting set. [D]ata scientists help decision makers shift from ad
hoc analysis to an ongoing conversation with data. Data scientists realize
that they face technical limitations, but they don’t allow that to bog down
their search for novel solutions. [T]he dominant trait among data scientists
is an intense curiosity—a desire to go beneath the surface of a problem, ﬁnd
the questions at its heart, and distill them into a very clear set of
hypotheses that can be tested. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davenport_data_2012">Davenport and Patil 2012</a>)</span></p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Learning from data<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-from-data"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>For pith, we can turn to <span class="citation">Donoho (<a href="#ref-donoho_50_2017">2017</a>)</span>: “Data science [is] the science of
learning from data, with all that this entails,” to which he adds, “it studies
the methods involved in the analysis and processing of data and proposes
technology to improve methods in an evidence-based manner.”</p>
<p>For plainness, we can turn to my working definition: “a set of core activities
to ask good scientific questions and to line up the tools to answer them
rigorously using data.” I developed that formulation in 2016, drawing on <em>The
Art of Data Science</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-peng_art_2015">Peng and Matsui 2015</a>)</span>. My operating definition of data science
links rather than separate the tasks of stating and solving problems, mediated
through data. Peng and Matsui enumerated 5 core activities, to which I add a
sixth. I explicitly link each of these 6 core activities to analysis, since data
analysis is a central commitment of data science, as I explain further below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pose good questions</strong>. The set of potential questions is enriched through
awareness of the kinds of learning that various analytic methods support.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare data to address those questions</strong>. With the purposes of analysis in
mind, the practitioner can obtain, manage, and explore data to ensure the
data’s fitness to address the analytic purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Probe the data</strong>. Conduct rigorous analysis to address questions, which
includes developing and critically assessing one or more analytic models. The
value of analysis itself comes from the ability to answer the question and to
convey what is learned from data.</p>
<p><strong>Place analytic results in context</strong>. Interpretation binds the question to
the method, binds the method to the result, and puts them all into the context
of assumptions about the data, technical assumptions in the analytic models,
existing domain knowledge, and alternative analytic approaches that could have
been considered. Understanding what specific data can’t tell you, or what
phenomena those data rule out, is as valuable as interpreting what the data
show.</p>
<p><strong>Present methods and results</strong>. Communication shares what has been learned
from data and how it was learned, and it also subjects the life cycle to
scrutiny and transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Preserve the entire life cycle</strong>. Ensure that the life cycle is traceable,
accessible, reproducible, and enduring to the extent possible. In addition to
communicating methods and results, transparency ensures that the data and
analytic code are as available as possible, subject to privileges of access
where necessary. This transparency in turn supports fundamental scientific
norms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Peng and Matsui took care to explain that their core activities do not need to,
and often do not, occur in sequence. Rather, with the execution of each core
activity, careful reflection could lead the practitioner to repeat, jump back,
or jump forward. I expand on this idea later in this section.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Blei and Smyth (<a href="#ref-blei_science_2017">2017</a>)</span> wrote, “Although each of [statistical, computational, and
human perspectives] is a critical component of data science, we argue that the
effective combination of all three components is the essence of what data
science is about. ... The practice of data science is not just a single step of
analyzing a dataset. Rather, it cycles between data preprocessing, exploration,
selection, transformation, analysis, interpretation, and communication. One of
the main priorities for data science is to develop the tools and methods that
facilitate this cycle.”</p>
<p>The Data Science Association <a href="https://www.datascienceassn.org/code-of-conduct.html"><u>focuses on
meaning</u></a>:
Data science is “the scientific study of the creation, validation and
transformation of data to create meaning” , and a data scientist is “a
professional who uses scientific methods to liberate and create meaning from raw
data.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-data_science_association_data_nodate">Data Science Association</a>)</span></p>
<p>The National Institutes of Health <em>Strategic Plan for Data Science</em> defined it
as “the interdisciplinary field of inquiry in which quantitative and analytical
approaches, processes, and systems are developed and used to extract knowledge
and insights from increasingly large and/or complex sets of data.”
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-national_institutes_of_health_nih_2018">National Institutes of Health 2018</a>)</span></p>
<p>The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine described data
science along with its relationship to other fields, its primary tasks, and its
primary purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Data science centers on] multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches
to extracting knowledge or insights from data for use in a broad range of
applications. It is the field of science that relies on processes and systems
(mathematical, computational, and social) to derive information or insights
from data. It is about synthesizing the most relevant parts of the
foundational disciplines to solve particular classes of problems or
applications while also creating novel techniques to address the ‘cracks’
between those disciplines where no approaches may yet exist … because the
volume and variety of data available are expanding swiftly, data are more
available immediately, and decisions based on data are increasingly automated
and in real time. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-national_academies_of_sciences_envisioning_2018">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2018</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2015
defined data science as the “Extraction of actionable knowledge directly from
data through a process of discovery, or hypothesis formulation and hypothesis
testing.” Per NIST, a data scientist is “a practitioner with sufficient
knowledge in the overlapping regimes of business needs, domain knowledge,
analytical skills, and software and systems engineering to manage the end-to-end
data processes in the data life cycle … The end-to-end role ensures that
everything is performed correctly to explore the data, create and validate
hypotheses.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nist_big_data_public_working_group_nist_2015">NIST Big Data Public Working Group 2015</a>)</span> The data life cycle
is “a set of processes in an application that transform raw data into actionable
knowledge”:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Collection</strong>: Gather and store raw data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Preparation</strong>: Convert raw data into cleansed, organized information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis</strong>: Synthesize knowledge from organized information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Action</strong>: Use synthesized knowledge to generate value for the enterprise.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>NIST’s definitions appear in the context of discussing “big data” that cannot be
accommodated by traditional architectures. Data volume (size), variety (sources,
domains, and types), velocity (rate of flow), and variability (changing
characteristics) “drive the shift to … architectures for data-intensive
applications.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-nist_big_data_public_working_group_nist_2015">NIST Big Data Public Working Group 2015</a>)</span> As a
semi-contrarian, I prefer plain-language versions of these concepts:</p>
<div class="inline-table"><table style="width:100%;" class="table table-sm">

</table></div>
<p>These varied definitions of data science explicitly invoke learning, answering
questions, creating meaning, and extracting knowledge—epistemic tasks that
take us into the nature, sources, structure, and limits of empirically derived
knowledge. Learning defines data science, which in turn centers data science on
the role of analysis. These definitions vary in whether and how they appeal to
processes (such as a data life cycle and adaptive problem-solving), means
(complex data), and methods (quantitative and analytical approaches and
technology). These definitions also suggest but do not enumerate the skills that
are needed to do data science.</p>
<p>I agree with the NIH and NASEM definitions in that current and evolving
complexity drive a need for adapted methods. As data and technologies become
more complex, the drive for adaptively learning from data also intensifies. The
risk I see is that we might overinvest in narrow (but potentially useful) skills
while giving short shrift to broadly applicable but underserved skills: We
should respect the fundamentals and avoid an unfortunate tendency to
overemphasize the exotic or the complex at the expense of those fundamentals.
Indeed, <span class="citation">Donoho (<a href="#ref-donoho_50_2017">2017</a>)</span> makes a similar case. We cannot lose sight of the need
for learning from conventional or familiar data, using conventional or familiar
methods. In addition to basic skills for managing and analyzing data, we need
always to esteem skills for critical reflection and reasoning in creative but
disciplined ways. In this sense, complexity and sophistication <em>motivate</em> data
science, but they <em>do not define</em> data science, and it is a mistake to
overidentify data science with those drivers. It would also be a mistake to
focus on the technology rather than the science: Learning from data is a
scientific act, enabled by evolving methods and tools. The value of learning
from data needs to be judged by scientific rather than technological norms. Have
we posed questions of social value and scientific validity? <span class="citation">(See also <a href="#ref-freedman_scientific_1987">Freedman 1987</a>.)</span> Have we prepared the data to answer those questions?
Have we adequately probed the data and placed findings in context? Are proposed
conclusions traceable and defensible? Is the reasoning coherent? We will return
to this point when we talk about <em>how</em> data science is done.</p>
</div>
<div id="core-activities-and-critical-reflection" class="section level3" number="3.1.3">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.3</span> Core activities and critical reflection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#core-activities-and-critical-reflection"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Peng and Matsui’s schema for the core activities of the art
of data science goes deeper than merely listing those activities: Each core
activity calls for critical reflection, in which the practitioner reviews each
core activity by framing, checking, and possibly revising or revisiting that
activity.</p>
<p>First, set your expectations for the core activity. Then collect information and
compare your expectations to your information. If they don’t match, then take
another look and either revise your expectations or your information. Maybe
repeat the current core activity or return to a previous one. If they do match,
then you’re in a good place, but you should occasionally check again for good
measure, lest you fall into a confirmation bias trap.</p>
<p>In a real sense, critical reflection puts the <em>science</em> in <em>data science</em>. We
can associate each core activity with example prompts for critical reflection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Pose good questions</strong>. Is the question of interest? Valid and valuable?
Consult with experts or the literature. If needed, revise the question.</p>
<p><strong>Prepare data to address those questions</strong>. Are the data suited to the
question? Examine data early and often to learn about structure, content, and
suitability. If needed, refine the question or obtain more or different data.</p>
<p><strong>Probe the data</strong>. Does the analytic model answer the question? Does it use
data correctly and take a suitable form for explaining or predicting a
phenomenon of interest? Challenge model assumptions and structure. If needed,
revise model structure or inputs.</p>
<p><strong>Place analytic results in context</strong>. Does the analysis provide a meaningful
answer that holds up to scrutiny and contributes to domain knowledge? Assess
the totality of analyses—effect sizes, accuracy or bias, variability or
uncertainty—in consideration of varying assumptions about the data, the
model, and the subject-matter context for the question. If needed, revise the
analysis to provide a specific, meaningful answer or conduct diagnostics or
sensitivity analyses to assess limitations and assumptions.</p>
<p><strong>Present methods and results</strong>. Are the methods and results understood,
complete, and meaningful to the audience? Assess content, style, and attitude
and gauge audience feedback. If needed, revise the presentation to suit
audience needs.</p>
<p><strong>Preserve the entire life cycle</strong>. Are the data and analysis as open and
transparent as possible? Assess whether data and analytic code can be made
available with or without alteration or access controls, for example, through
public repositories or under user agreements. If needed, work toward the least
restrictive means for sharing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These critical reflections show why the core activities need not occur in
sequence. Indeed, some or all core activities could occur more than once for a
given undertaking.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.1.4</span> Commitments: life cycle, centered on analysis, subject to norms<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#commitments-life-cycle-centered-on-analysis-subject-to-norms"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I have taken a broad view in surveying a variety of motivations and definitions
for data science. In consideration of this breadth and variety, I contend that
data science entails 3 main commitments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>We learn from data in the context of an overall life cycle</strong>: posing rich
questions about the world, amenable to rich methods; guiding how we
generate, transmit, obtain, and prepare data; probing data to answer
questions about the world; placing answers from data in context, mindful of
assumptions and alternatives; presenting data-driven answers to audiences
clearly and correctly; and preserving those answers and ensure that the
entire life cycle is transparent, accessible, traceable and, to the extent
possible, reproducible.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analysis centrally connects the life cycle of data</strong>. We pose questions,
prepare data, place results in context, and present answers informed by the
variety of available analytic approaches. If we have methods for analyzing
images, then we can ask questions that only images can answer. To interpret
and communicate a risk or a rate of change seen in a set of data, we infer
meaning from the analytic method. As further discussed below, we have many
analytic modes available to us beyond traditional statistical methods, such
as causal inference and machine learning.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>We judge data science approaches and claims by scientific norms</strong>. Since
data science is about extracting knowledge through analyzing data, then it
should be judged by the same criteria that apply to extracting knowledge
from observations. This commitment is familiar within statistical practice;
it needs to become familiar with other data-analytic modes, including
machine learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These 3 commitments unpack what it means to learn from data, and they set some
boundaries around that practice. They point to the practitioner’s responsibility
for respecting context, respecting analytic intent, and respecting quality and
rigor. They also point us in the direction of needed investments in resources
and learning. These commitments are not, however, meant to imply that each
person who practices data science individually carries out each activity. (See
also section <a href="who.html#doing">5.3</a>.) Let’s examine those boundaries and some disciplines
that are related to, but distinct from, data science.</p>
</div>

<h2>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> What data science <em>is not</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-not"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Data science overlaps other disciplines and scientific practices. Furthermore,
as <span class="citation">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (<a href="#ref-national_academies_of_sciences_envisioning_2018">2018</a>)</span> notes, the practice of data
science necessarily crosses disciplines. How does data science relate to
statistics and other modes of data analysis, to informatics, and to science in
general? How should the practice of data science privilege science over
technology and focus on meaning and rigor?</p>
<div id="data-science-is-not-statistics" class="section level3" number="3.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2.1</span> Data science is not statistics<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-science-is-not-statistics"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Statistics is not the same as data science, though the field substantially
overlaps with data science. Moreover, data science is not merely statistics
dressed up with appealing marketing. I argue above that data science takes
responsibility for the whole life cycle of data, connected centrally through
analytic concerns. In this understanding, a statistician who limits their
engagement solely to analysis and perhaps interpretation is not doing data
science. A statistician who does analysis and engages the rest of the life cycle
of data is doing data science—as is an epidemiologist, a sociologist, a
microbiologist, or anyone else.</p>
<p><span class="citation">Donoho (<a href="#ref-donoho_50_2017">2017</a>)</span> and <span class="citation">Jones (<a href="#ref-jones_how_2018">2018</a>)</span> show that data science took shape as a
discipline, in part, in reaction to the failure of academic statistics to focus
sufficiently on pragmatic rather than theoretical concerns. This
characterization cuts in 2 directions: While academic statistics might have
shunned practical concerns, academic and applied statistics firmly root
themselves in traditions of rigor and other scientific norms. On the other hand,
machine learning and other analytic disciplines are not as firmly rooted. To be
fair, academic machine learning—often located in computer science or
information science departments—pays heed to rigorous mathematics,
out-of-sample generalizability, and applied issues such as bias and fairness.
But the traditions are not as deep, and the norms are not as strong.</p>
<p>Leo Breiman, the late UC Berkeley statistics faculty member and an early
bridge-builder between statistical and machine-learning communities, said that
he might advise a young person (in 2001), “Don’t go into statistics.” In the
end, he would say, “Take statistics, but remember that the great adventure of
statistics is in gathering and using data to solve interesting and important
real world problems.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-olshen_conversation_2001">Olshen 2001</a>)</span></p>
<p>Andrew Gelman, Columbia faculty member and prolific blogger, wrote in 2013,
“Statistics is the least important part of data science … Statistics is
important—don’t get me wrong … But it’s not the most important part of data
science, or even close.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gelman_statistics_2013">Gelman 2013</a>)</span></p>

<p>The field of statistics connects disciplines and practices for constructing and
probing models grounded in probability theory and inference. This
characterization holds for frequentist, Bayesian, and other approaches, whether
the probability model is highly specified (as with parametric models) or loosely
specified (as with nonparametric models). Many other approaches to data analysis
might have a probability component that is not of primary concern or might have
no formal probability component at all.</p>
<p>Machine learning has been described as the answer to the question, “How can
computers learn to solve problems without being explicitly programmed?” In
practice, computers “learn” to solve problems by looking for mathematically
representable patterns in data (such as clusters or topic models) or by
constructing mathematical tools to guess an output, given a set of inputs,
modeled on examples that associate known inputs with known outputs. In these
senses, machine learning is data analysis. As a field and collection of methods,
machine learning overlaps substantially with statistics, distinguished by its
emphasis on finding patterns and making predictions rather than constructing
models that directly represent data—even when a machine learning model is
explicitly probability-based or a model’s performance is represented using
concepts from probability.</p>
<p>There is no bright line between statistics and machine learning, and many
methods inhere to both disciplines. For example, classical statistics has
traditions of cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, and regularization,
and machine learning uses Bayes’s theorem and logistic regression for binary
classification tasks. Although machine learning is often associated with complex
models based on vast amounts of data, statistical models can be complex, with
many model parameters, or they can be based on large amounts of data.
Conversely, machine learning models can be simple or based on small data. Since
machine learning models tend to emphasize predictive performance (outputs given
inputs) rather than internal model structure, however, the largest data-analytic
models in practice tend to use machine learning methods. Some deep learning
models have billions, or possibly trillions, of model parameters. I discuss
machine learning, along with artificial intelligence, at greater length below in
section <a href="ml-ai.html#ml-ai">8</a>.</p>
<p>Other modes of data analysis beyond statistics include causal inference,
geospatial methods, econometric methods, and compartmental and agent-based
modeling. <span class="citation">Pearl (<a href="#ref-pearl_causality_2009">2009</a>)</span> explicitly characterizes causal inference as
extrastatistical; without additional strong assumptions, no probability model
can inherently represent causality. Structural equation models and inverse
probability weighting can help to disentangle a causal signal from random noise,
subject to those extrastatistical assumptions. Geospatial and econometric
methods also often use probability components, for example, to accommodate
correlations in space or time, but they wed those components to other concepts.
Compartmental and agent-based modeling might or might not use empirical
observations, but when they do, any probability components for solving or
simulating systems also extend beyond strictly probability-based models.</p>
<p>From the perspective of data science, the life cycle of data can center on any
or all of these analytic disciplines, not just statistics. This perspective
covers 2 of my 3 commitments of data science: the life cycle and the central
concern of data analysis. The third commitment, to scientific norms and rigor,
obtains when the practitioner acknowledges and respects the norms inherent to
the various models of analysis. For machine learning, for example, these norms
include out-of-sample generalizability and model robustness and stability. Thus,
not only is it wrong to characterize data science as an enhanced form of
statistics, such a characterization risks failing to hold other analytic modes
to similar expectations of rigor and norms.</p>
<p>Much more could be written about whether machine learning or other modes of
analysis reveal “meaning” in data, as some data science definitions seek to do.
For now, I note that all such modes, including statistics, can be subjected to
various methods for interpretation in terms of model structure and the
relationship of models to input data. Furthermore, such interpretations and
accompanying explanations warrant careful critical evaluation in view of a broad
swath of scientific norms, not least because an apparent interpretation or
explanation can itself be an illusion regardless of the method of analysis.</p>

<p>Public health informatics is the systematic application of information and
computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and
learning. Informatics applies technology to obtain, store, and use information.
Per <span class="citation">Savel and Foldy (<a href="#ref-savel_role_2012">2012</a>)</span>, it concerns “the how and why of technology and systems
versus the common what and where of information technology … the <em>integration
and proper application</em> of technology and systems to get data rather than just
the technology and systems” (emphasis added) … “frequently the application of
standards and structure that help with meaning before data science gets to it.”
My colleague Brian Lee has said (personal communication), “Informatics is all
the work of understanding and making data available to determine meaning”. Thus,
we can see that informatics and data science overlap, especially regarding data
wrangling, movement, accessibility, and scale, but the fields take different
orientations: Data science seeks meaning from data, empowered by informatics to
work with data. The disciplines in each field are important, and one can
practice the collection of disciplines across those fields. It is important,
however, not to conflate them nor to treat one field as a subset of the other.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">3.2.4</span> Data science is not just good science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#data-science-is-not-just-good-science"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Much of scientific practice in public health uses, or purports to use, data that
come from observations about individual health status and other aspects of the
world. When public health science uses data, then it should conform to
scientific norms and rigor, much as I have claimed data science should. Does it
follow, then, that data science is just good science? The answer is <em>no</em>, both
because data science inherits some commitments that do not apply broadly to the
practice of science and because good science entails commitments that do not
apply to data science.</p>
<p>By “good science” I mean, in brief, all those practices for building and
organizing knowledge about the world through the methods and values of
experiment and observation, neutrality, rigor, transparency, empiricism,
reproducibility, minimizing subjective bias, and so on.</p>
<p>On the expectation that theoretical science need not use data at all, we can
omit theoretical science and narrow our question to applied science. Even
narrowed in this way, we can conclude that not all applied science uses data.
While all applied science depends on observation and precedent, those contexts
need not entail <em>data</em> in the sense of observations represented in a way that we
can subject them to further analysis. For example, without implicating data, a
scientist can classify an organism through observation or conduct a qualitative
review of published literature to structure arguments and conclusions about the
state of knowledge in a specified domain. Next, not all applied science that
uses data, uses it well. While we could argue that applied science that uses
data poorly is not “good science”, we should also acknowledge that applied
science can consist of good and bad components in which the poor use of data
does not undermine the entire project. Finally, and pivotally, not all applied
science that uses data well also takes responsibility for the integrity of the
life cycle of data and for connecting that data life cycle to how questions are
posed, data obtained, analysis performed, results placed in context, methods and
results presented, and the whole process preserved. Just as a statistician can
conduct a rigorous data analysis without connecting that analysis to the life
cycle of data, any other scientist can engage in portions of the scientific
method, including portions of the life cycle of data, without having applied
data science. Data science entails taking responsibility for the integrity of
the life cycle of data—across the core activities of data science—in a way
that does not apply to the full breadth of “good science”. Without question,
doing data science well overlaps with doing good science, but it is important
not to conflate them.</p>
<p>The life cycle of data is consistent with, but not synonymous with, the
scientific method. This distinction between “good science” and data science
matters because the distinction informs how we do data science, which in turn
differs in emphasis and kind from how we do good science. In particular, the
technical and nontechnical skills that support the practice of data science,
especially the skills for locating data analysis as a central focus in the life
cycle of data, do not generalize or scale to the wholesale conduct of good
science.</p>
