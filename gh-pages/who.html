</h2>
<p>Everyone who wants to do good things with data should have the intellectual
support to do so, as long as they proceed with rigor and stand behind their
work. I first formulated this credo in 2016. I asked, “Who gets to do data
science?” to express both empowerment (who has the ability) and privilege (who
has the authority). I was proclaiming that one need not be an expert in
statistics or computer science to perform well when working with data. Indeed,
nonstatisticians can, and often do, perform great work with data.</p>
<p>I believe this credo because of my own experience mentoring, coaching, and
advising learners through a variety of CDC or CDC-adjacent programs, including
fellowship and student internship programs, with undergraduates, masters and
doctoral students, and postgraduate learners. For the first few years in my
CSELS ADDS role, I emphasized the learning-oriented, empowering component of
data science: “<em>everyone</em> who wants to do good things with data”. In my
mentoring experience, a learner’s specific analytic or technical background has
been a poor predictor of how well they would do, especially in programs that
don’t recruit specifically for previous analytic or technical education. For
example, I have worked with several physicians who had no specific statistics
background, who went on to execute superb analyses, some even winning awards. In
each case, they proceeded with rigor and stood behind their work. My role was
merely as mentor; they took up the challenges of doing data science. Conversely,
some learners with apparent analytic background either shunned rigorous analysis
or fumbled badly. CDC programs <em>can</em> select for prior technical or analytic
experience, but I don’t believe that CDC programs <em>need</em> to do so.</p>
<p>Who gets to do data science? I can restate the question echoing my credo as
follows: Who wants to do good things with data, proceed with rigor, and stand
behind their work? I can restate the question again, echoing my working
definition of data science : Who will line up tools to ask and answer good
questions rigorously using data? I have the same answer for all 3 versions of
the question. <strong>Self-learning problem-solvers get to do data science</strong>: people
who connect a love of knowledge to self-learning and solving problems, people
who ask thoughtful questions, pay close attention to details, honestly
acknowledge what they don’t know, probe for deeper meaning, and persist in the
face of obstacles. (See also <span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_educating_2013">2013b</a>)</span>.)</p>
<p>In 2016, I felt energized to tout such an empowering message focused on learning
rather than specific disciplines. I slowly realized that this message was
incomplete. While I situated self-learning problem-solvers in learning-oriented
communities with mentors and advocates, I needed to say more about who learners,
mentors, and advocates are, where specific technical and nontechnical skills fit
in, how that community operates beyond learning. So from mid-2016 through
mid-2019, my primary formulation transmuted from <em>Who gets to do data science</em>
to the more expansive and inclusive <em>Who participates in a progressive culture
for data</em>. I began acknowledging that nonexperts who do good things with data
often need guidance from experts to empower those achievements. Furthermore,
nonexperts and experts alike need support and other resources from other members
of the progressive culture for data.</p>
<p>I also believe that CDC has a substantial, untapped well of potential among
existing staff for doing good, and better, things with data. In other words, CDC
could achieve, or make great strides toward, a progressive culture for data with
the right attention and direction regarding learning, doing, staffing, and
leading. I have not seen CDC as a whole make those moves, though pockets here
and there show promise.</p>
<p>Who gets to do data science? Echoing NIST, the Office of Personnel Management
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-reinhold_data_2019">Reinhold 2019</a>)</span> says, “Practitioners with sufficient knowledge in the
areas of business needs, domain knowledge, analytical skills, and software and
systems engineering to manage the end-to-end data processes in the data life
cycle. Overlapping skills including data analysis, analytical applications, big
data engineering, algorithms, domain expertise, statistics and machine learning.
[They] use expertise in one or more of these domains to solve complex data
problems.” This answer lacks poetry but specifies a few details in terms of
knowledge, skills, and work activities. These details are useful for creating
staffing strategies, occupational qualifications, and position descriptions.</p>
<p>Finally, who leads in a progressive culture for data? Everyone should get to.</p>

</h2>
<p>In 2018, I added the following to my growing collection of personal mottos:
“Less training, more learning.” By this I meant that our culture should
explicitly recognize and support personal initiative and self-direction as
ways—in my view the most important ways—of gaining knowledge and experience
for solving real problems, especially after entering the workforce. Community
supports learning about data, and learning how to do data science, by centering
on learners. Learning can follow formal curricula and be encouraged in
structured programs, but substantial portions of learning occur in informal
settings, as through reading, self-guided learning, and interaction with peers.
In my experience, a culture that overemphasizes training risks undervaluing the
full gamut of the ways that learners learn.</p>
<p>A focus on learning respects the agency and responsibility of the learner, who
has to take an active role not only in receiving instruction but in practicing
and honing what is learned. A focus on learning further opens the way for
various models and modes of learning, including self-teaching through reading,
crafty on-line searching, independent tutorials, and experimentation.
Self-guided and experiential learners need guidance from others, mentoring, and
help identifying or filtering through material that can assist in learning.
Learning concerns not only individual development but also better serving the
shared mission, for example, by asking better questions, working better with
data sources or structures, and communicating rigorously and clearly to a
variety of audiences. Learning should not focus only on technical skills but
also on the means to exercise data acumen, good sense, and judgment.</p>
<p>Beyond developing skills among current staff, we need an agency culture that
provides intellectual support to everyone who wants to do good things with data,
whether they already have the skills or not. For those who already have skills,
it’s a matter of supporting good practice, supporting continuing development,
and encouraging that they support others. For those who lack skills, it’s a
matter of providing support that is more oriented to learning new skills or to
adapting skills from other areas.</p>
<div id="relational-learning" class="section level3" number="5.2.1">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">5.2.1</span> Relational learning<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#relational-learning"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>I start here with the relationship between learners—typically fellows,
students, or early-career scientists—and mentors, since this relationship
formed the initial impetus for my entire conception of a progressive culture for
data.</p>
<p><strong>Mentors</strong> create supportive conditions to guide other scientists to learn
about data and to learn from data. A mentor is responsible for guiding technical
skills to encourage a personalized direction for self-learning, sometimes as
specific as skills for managing relational databases, creating graphics that
smoothe binary outcomes, modeling seasonality, or exploring categorical data
using mosaic plots.</p>
<p>In my experience, <em>experience</em> has been more important for learning than
specific subject-matter knowledge. I typically guide the learner through clear
thinking and critical reflection more than particular methods. Mentors also
model intellectual virtues. They show by example as they openly practice
curiosity, courage, humility. Mentors also create regular opportunities for the
learner to practice intellectual virtues by stimulating curiosity, rewarding
courage, and fostering humility. In some ways, these nontechnical skills are
more fundamental to scientific practice than technical skills are: learning how
to learn and, more than that, how to exercise judgment regarding level of
effort, intensity of exploration, extent of experimentation, making interesting
mistakes. Practical wisdom matures in part through guidance and in part through
reflecting on one’s own lapses in intellectual virtue. A mentor can help the
learner with both.</p>
<p>In the context of education, <span class="citation">Baehr (<a href="#ref-baehr_educating_2013">2013b</a>)</span> explained that educating for
intellectual character growth is <strong>personal</strong>, because it involves thinking of
learners as persons whose basic beliefs, attitudes, and feelings about knowledge
and learning also matter critically to the quality of their education; it is
necessarily <strong>social</strong> or <strong>relational</strong>, because personal change and growth
occur most readily in the context of trusting and caring relationships; and, it
is <strong>reflective</strong>, because it involves reflecting on and discussing with
learners the value of thinking and learning, regularly pausing to identify or
reflect on the significance of what is being learned. The mentoring relationship
responds to and nurtures a love of and interest in thinking, learning, answering
good questions. “Intellectual virtues flow, not from a desire for praise or
approval, but out of a genuine interest in thinking and learning.”
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-baehr_cultivating_2015">Baehr 2015</a>)</span></p>
<p>As a mentor, I often explain my thought process to the learner, as messy and
nonsensical as that thought process might be. Thinking out loud with a learner,
usually when I have no idea whether I’m making sense, is real and honest. It is
also an exercise in vulnerability. In turn, the mentor must earn the trust and
respect of the learner, so that the learner is able to take risks to make
interesting mistakes in their own thought processes.</p>
<p>CDC needs to do a better job of finding and supporting mentors in informal and
formal ways. In the discussion below on staffing and capacity for data science,
I propose some approaches through articulating competencies and accounting for
performance.</p>
<p>In a robust culture supported by mentoring, the mentoring relationships go in
several directions. I started with the relationship of the mentor to the
learner. In communities of peers, learners can mentor each other in the same
personal, relational, and reflective ways as mentors do with learners. In
addition, mentors could benefit from guidance and wisdom from experienced
mentors, or what I call “meta-mentoring”. Finally, advocates influence, guide,
and support the learning-oriented community.</p>
<p><strong>Learners</strong> ask questions, solve problems, reflect critically on process, and
improve their skills. They take responsibility for self-learning, seek
mentorship, and practice technical skills and intellectual virtues. Learners
take risks and make interesting mistakes, from which they learn how to exercise
judgment. Learners use data responsibility to improve the world. Learners
participate in community through fellowships and other learning programs,
communities of practice, scientific workgroups, interest groups, and user
groups. The Statistical and Machine Learning Community of Practice was a
community for learning from data, an example grass-roots network of learners
that brought together members of scientific workgroups, user groups, and other
groups.</p>
<p><strong>Advocates</strong> influence the practice and profession of data science, promote and
reward commitments to data and to self-learning, remove needless barriers (e.g.,
technology-related procedures), support instructive failures and interesting
mistakes, encourage those who practice data science, and uphold those who
profess data science. Advocates include managers, decision-makers, associate
directors, directors, and others.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">5.2.2</span> Formal curricula and structured programs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#formal-curricula-and-structured-programs"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>A progressive culture for data can promote more systematic or standardized
learning through formal curricula for technical skills and for nontechnical
skills. A surfeit of vendors now offer courses on a wide variety of
computational and data-analytic skills. CDC makes many of these available
through OCIO, CDC University, programs like Advanced Molecular Detection, and
sessions organized by CDC workgroups and user groups. In addition to the endless
options for courses on technical skills, curricula are also available for
nontechnical skills (e.g., <a href="https://intellectualvirtues.org/">Educating for Intellectual
Virtues</a>), though they are not as readily
available.</p>
<p>CDC has a rich, long, and successful history of structured, experiential
learning programs, including some for professionals outside of CDC. Until
recently, these programs have not intentionally and explicitly addressed data
science. The EIS program has addressed analytic skills in limited ways.
Informatics and prevention effectiveness programs have specific, narrow
technical areas of focus. Participants in these programs regularly benefit from
communities of mentors and peers, but those have also not purposefully addressed
data science.</p>
<p>Some recent developments demonstrate incremental shifts: The EIS program has
piloted and continues to provide mentoring to EIS fellows for advanced analytic
projects. The fellowship programs have also piloted efforts to create teams of
fellows from different programs for intentionally interdisciplinary work.
Recently, modernization initiatives have sponsored a small number of fellows to
focus on data science. Finally, the Data Science Upskilling (DSU) program
launched in 2019 with about a dozen teams of incumbent federal staff and
fellows, each focusing on a primary project, on-demand, online courses, and
cross-team activities on 5 components of data science: statistics, machine
learning, computing, visualization, and ethics.</p>
<p>DSU in particular allows federal staff and other learners to set aside time to
go deep on data and on methods that are new or unfamiliar to them, as well as
time for trial and error. The program is predicated on explicit organizational
support, including from supervisors, as well as structured leadership and access
to experts, learning resources, technical tools, and fellow learners.
Participants refine existing skills or learn new skills in analytic methods,
software such as R, Python, and Power BI—importantly, not limited by their
prior or primary occupational series or disciplines. They generally learn how to
establish clearer boundaries on their motivating data science projects, develop
workable (if preliminary) solutions, and establish a community of practice. Most
of the methods and tools used in DSU are not new, though they might be
unfamiliar or uncommon within CDC’s general culture. The program brings both an
overarching purpose and specific value to learners and their programs by
focusing on specific, mission-oriented problems. They thus establish, expand,
and apply methods, tools, and technology available for CDC to use rigorously.
Furthermore, they enrich their own and their teams’ ability to adapt to
fast-changing contexts: newer questions, less familiar data sources, and less
familiar methods and technology, all of which comes close to my vision for the
motivation and disposition of a progressive culture for data.</p>

<p>A progressive culture for data centers on learning in order to empower the
practice and profession of data science. Community supports the practice and
profession of data science by ensuring that everyone who wants to do good things
with data has the resources to do so. On this account, I see 4 primary roles in
that culture: learner-practitioners (which I also call “learners and doers”),
expert practitioners, managers, and lay advocates. These roles can change over
time and overlap with each other and with the roles that I articulated above as
learning-oriented roles (mentor, learner, and advocate). The roles capture the
essential distinctions for the primary practical needs of that culture for doing
good things with data.</p>
<p><strong>Learner-practitioners</strong> with basic or intermediate data skills come from any

</h3>
<p>Amidst the mixture of excitement and marketing hype about data scientists,
there’s a recurring question about whether data scientists are recruited and
hired from the outside or cultivated from the inside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Data scientists are hard to find and attract. … Data scientists are rare
commodities. … What data scientists do—curate data, ask the right
questions, build explanatory analytical models, implement the models into
various applications—is simply not scaling at the pace of demand.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-millis_data_2015">Millis 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A prominent data scientist in Silicon Valley ... doesn’t hire on the basis of
statistical or analytical capabilities. … [He] seeks both a skill set—a
solid foundation in math, statistics, probability, and computer science—and
certain habits of mind. He wants people with a feel for business issues and
empathy for customers. Then, he says, he builds on all that with on-the-job
training and an occasional course in a particular technology.
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-davenport_data_2012">Davenport and Patil 2012</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe you indeed learn data science on the job. It is true that data
scientists should know [some specific technical skills] … And self-learners
can catch up quickly … But focusing only on people who call themselves data
scientists is a mistake. <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-van_cauwenberghe_can_2015">Van Cauwenberghe 2015</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In these 3 quotations, we sense that data scientists are hard to come by.
Furthermore, since they need to keep up with fast-moving methods, tools, and
technology, they need a firm foundation in technical and nontechnical skills as
well as a disposition and self-sufficiency for continuous learning.</p>
<p>Federal workforce flexibilities afford a rich variety of staffing mechanisms and
organizational options for achieving and sustaining an effective mix: career
development among federal staff and other learners, recruiting new federal staff
and learners, adding collaborators from academia and other partners, and
acquiring data science services through contracts. This section provides a
brief, opinionated summary narrowly focused on a few considerations. I organize
the discussion around 6 broad, mutually exclusive segments:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Federal employees already on staff, including civil service and uniformed
staff</p></li>
<li><p>To-be-recruited federal employees</p></li>
<li><p>Federal and nonfederal staff in learning programs, glossing over some
nontrivial nuances distinguishing federal learners (e.g., some fellows hired
under Title 42) from nonfederal learners (e.g., ORISE research participants)</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborators from academia or funded under a grant or cooperative agreement</p></li>
<li><p>Research and development contractors from federally funded research and
development centers, university-affiliated research centers, and national
laboratories</p></li>
<li><p>Commercial vendors</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For ease of presentation in this section, I will sidestep some details that
cannot be ignored in practice. For example, by learning programs, I mean
staffing mechanisms such as fellowships, not coursework or programs like Data
Science Upskilling. In addition, I include academic collaborators under the
Intergovernmental Personnel Act or as Special Government Employees along with
grantees, even though IPA funding is executed like a contract (acquisition)
rather than a grant (assistance) and SGEs are technically civil federal
employees.</p>
<p>Some of the material in this section corresponds to similar, more expansive
discussions of the HHS Data Council’s Data-Oriented Workforce Subcommittee
<span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-gehrke_critical_2021">Gehrke et al. 2021</a>; <a href="#ref-wagner_authorities_2022">Wagner 2022</a>)</span>. The subcommittee’s reports
present rich, thoughtful, comprehensive detail on staffing and organizing for
data science in the federal workforce. While I provided some critical input to
the subcommittee, the views that I present here are my own.</p>
<div id="federal-employees" class="section level4" number="5.4.1.1">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.1.1</span> Federal employees<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#federal-employees"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>The federal government has been expanding options for classifying and developing
federal employees to do data science. Historically, occupational series in
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) have represented narrow
but workable disciplines, including engineering (0801), operations research
(1515), mathematics (1520), statistics (1529 and 1530), computer science (1550),
and to some extent information technology specialist (2210); some of these have
been combined into interdisciplinary positions, such as 0601/1530. Other
scientific or technical series in social and behavioral sciences (0101),
microbiology (0400 group), and health sciences (0600 group) have been used for
positions that focus on research or analysis. Around 2016, I wrote CDC’s first
position description (in series 1530) that explicitly included machine learning.</p>
<p>In 2018, the Office of Personnel Management issued direct-hiring authority for
STEM positions in economics, biology, engineering, physical sciences, and math
fields. Then in 2019, OPM released guidance for adding parenthetical “(Data
Scientist)” titling to several of these series <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-reinhold_data_2019">Reinhold 2019</a>)</span>. Managers
in the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control developed a set of
standard “(Data Scientist)” position descriptions in several series and grades.</p>
<p>In 2019, CDC hosted a sequence of Future of Work (FoW) workshops to develop data
science profiles. I appreciated the focused attention, but I perceived that the
approach did not provide much latitude for existing federal staff who are
experts in data science to influence the shape and direction of the effort. In
particular, data-oriented experts already in the workforce would have the direct
experience to inform what is needed for doing good things with data—like
existing supports and motivators (such as interesting problems and supervisory
support) as well as persistent challenges (like barriers to nimbly using no-cost
data science software). FoW’s contract support staff could say something about
the ways that industry improves its use of data, but they lacked awareness from
within CDC’s own culture of working with data. I also perceived that the
approach risked conflating informatics with data science rather than clarifying
the distinctions between them. On the benefit side, FoW fleshed out the concept
of data fluency as a minimum competency for much of the federal workforce. In my
schema above for <em>doing</em> in a progressive culture, managers and laypersons would
best support the culture by achieving at least data fluency.</p>
<p>Finally, in late 2021, OPM issued the new data science occupational series 1560.
The accompanying flysheet substantially emphasizes the defining importance of
the life cycle of data, but it covers job activities that are diffuse or
ill-defined enough that it will take special care to use the series effectively.
I would have preferred improving the way that federal agencies use existing
series, including flexibility with titling and combining series, but the
development deserves to be taken seriously. Thus, CDC is actively working to
develop qualifications, competencies, position descriptions, and other resources
for recruiting and hiring data scientists.</p>
<p>Based on my experience with learners, user groups, and other early-career
professionals at CDC, I believe that unrecognized and untapped potential already
exists among incumbent federal staff and that CDC has so far failed to see and
characterize this potential. To realize this latent capacity, we need to shift
our thinking from traditional assessments of existing skills and traditional
emphasis on training, to assessments of aptitudes and habits of mind and a
radically different take on on-the-job learning that rewards self-learning and
nurturing networks with peers and mentors. At least as important, we should be
finding out from employees and learners with these experiences or interests what
they need and want in order to do good things with data, rather than a narrow
top-down focus on what only managers perceive—especially managers unfamiliar
with the motivations, commitments, and prospects of data science. It makes
little sense to me to talk about recruitment and retention without examining
what makes prospective or practicing data science practitioners <em>want</em> in order
to join the workforce and stay in it.</p>
<p>Tapping this potential also calls for a culture shift among staff themselves who
do or can do data science. While it can be important, for example, for a
statistician to maintain the professional identity of their discipline,
statisticians (and computer scientists and others) need to see themselves as
part of, rather than separate from, intentional cross-disciplinary engagement.</p>
<p>Turning to hiring, CDC faces well known challenges competing with other sectors.
Aware of limited flexibility to enhance incentives for prospective hires, what
nonfinancial incentives can CDC offer? Foremost, CDC’s unique mission and public
service already draws employees from many disciplines; that is, CDC appeals to
many recruits’ personal values. Second, if CDC cultivates a truly progressive
culture for data—one that rewards a drive to learn as well as a drive to
contribute—then CDC becomes that much more attractive to exactly the kind of
people who can sustain and enrich that progressive culture. But the culture has
to be genuine, or else its attractiveness will fade.</p>
<p>Stepping back from the fine details of series and grade, whether federal data
science staff are cultivated from within or hired from outside, the most
important <em>operational</em> considerations pertain to competencies and performance.
CDC needs practitioners who are able to do data science, whether as part or as
all of their duties. As a side benefit of CDC efforts to flesh out series 1560,
human resources staff have been developing a richly varied set of competencies,
work activities, and proficiencies. Those supportive resources can and should
shape other series beyond the new 1560. A 1530 statistician could adopt the more
expansive data-analytic competency or the enriched competency for machine
learning and artificial intelligence. And those same human resource concepts can
and should be adapted into performance elements and statements, so that everyone
who does data science can be accountable and rewarded for doing so. In addition
to competencies and performance elements that arise from series 1560, CDC should
also develop competencies for skills associated with intellectual virtues.
Skills and competencies oriented to learning, practical judgment, and mentoring
could also help to differentiate proficiency and grade within series and could
(and should) apply to other scientific series.</p>

<div id="fellows-and-other-learners" class="section level4" number="5.4.1.2">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.1.2</span> Fellows and other learners<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fellows-and-other-learners"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>CDC manages or partners on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/fellowships/index.html">dozens of structured learning
programs</a> on dozens of topics, open
to persons with a variety of educational backgrounds. Fellows stimulate, and
demonstrate CDC’s commitment to, a vital culture of learning. CDC sometimes
hires fellows as federal staff, often as an intentional career path. Although
CDC fellows contribute to CDC’s product, their primary purpose is to learn, not
to augment staff.</p>
<p>A fraction of CDC fellows focus largely on doing good things with data. A larger
fraction get to do good things with data, whether they focus on data or not.</p>
<p>I believe that CDC should commit to helping CDC programs develop data science
capacity through a focus on fellows, with the follow-on intention that other
members of a learner’s program unit can also develop their own data literacy or
competency. Early drafts of the 2018 Public Health Data Strategy called for
ready response unit of data scientists who would work with CDC programs as
needed. If such a unit were to be created, I recommended having it focus on
working through fellows, such that the requesting CDC program would develop the
capacity to address the data-oriented need rather than relying on outside staff
to take care of it and move on. (As a side note, the Center for Forecasting and
Outbreak Analytics largely goes the opposite direction from my recommendation,
investing substantial data science resources in that center and rather than
distributing them among other CDC programs.)</p>
<p>All these fellows need support from peers and mentors. To that end, CDC should
foster mentoring as a supported competency, with accountability and reward
through performance appraisal and other incentives. CDC should not, however,
overinstitutionalize mentoring, because the role itself needs latitude and
flexibility for fostering both technical and nontechnical skills.</p>
</div>
<div id="nonfederal-collaborators" class="section level4" number="5.4.1.3">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.1.3</span> Nonfederal collaborators<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nonfederal-collaborators"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>In addition to federal employees and learners, nonfederal collaborators serve
some of CDC’s data science needs, through joint research or other projects with
academic or public health partners, through research and development
organizations, and through commercial vendors. CDC often engages with academic
and public health collaborators through grants and cooperative agreements or
through a so-called mobility agreement under the Intergovernmental Personnel Act
(which is administered more like a contract than a grant). Research and
development organizations include federally funded research and development
centers (FFRDCs, such as those operated by the MITRE Corporation or the RAND
Corporation), university-affiliated research centers (UARCs, such as the Georgia
Tech Research Institute and the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University), and national laboratories (such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory
and Sandia National Laboratories). Finally, commercial vendors include a vast
collection of entities that bid to sell proprietary services to CDC under the
Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p>
<p>These outside contributors can especially help by filling in gaps in CDC’s own
capacity for data science activities varying in discipline, skill, or scale that
CDC can’t address on its own. It’s important for CDC, through advocates and
managers, to strive toward building capacity among CDC’s federal staff and to
avoid assuming that only outside collaborators can do a particular thing (such
as some forms of text or image analysis). As I’ve argued elsewhere in this
essay, CDC’s federal staff and learners likely have substantial, unrecognized
capacity for extending CDC’s data science capabilities into unrealized
directions. It would be a mistake to outsource based on a faulty assumption.</p>
<p>Many needs <em>do</em> exceed CDC’s current capacity. When it is necessary to turn to
nonfederal collaborators, it becomes especially important to have enough
expertise among CDC’s federal staff (or at a bare minimum among trusted
nonfederal partners) to ensure that contributions from nonfederal collaborators
meet the intended need. How do we know if we’re getting something useful, or
what we need, from these collaborators? I have observed more than one project in
which a nonfederal collaborator—sometimes academic, sometimes
commercial—supplied a deliverable that the home CDC program was unable to
evaluate. In those instances, greater data science expertise within the CDC
program, or through another service or community within CDC, could have helped
to ensure that the proposed deliverables would be worth the investment and that
the actual deliverables met the need.</p>

</h4>
<p>As described in previous sections, a progressive culture for data needs data
science learner-practitioners (from a variety of disciplines), expert
practitioners (specifically data science disciplines), managers, and lay
advocates. A discussion that focuses only on experts is incomplete and
short-sighted. Not everyone needs to be a data scientist to be empowered to do
good or to be held to a high standard. And not everyone needs to be held to a
high standard.</p>
<p>Should analysts or data scientists be integrated with staff from other
disciplines or set apart? This question and the reality cut both ways:
statisticians and other data staff are often set apart, and they often prefer it
that way. In a largely remote, post-Covid workplace configuration, the
organizational question comes down to 2 main characteristics that we can think
of as <em>within</em> and <em>between</em>: Should data staff be located in units that are
homogenous or mixed with collaborating staff of other disciplines? How connected
should data staff be across distinct units? I’ve seen some version of each
configuration. The idea of grouping data scientists together seems like a wise
way to manage limited resources, but in my experience, it fosters the notion
that data scientists <em>ought</em> to be separate. During CDC’s Futures Initiative in
the early aughts, there was talk of putting all statisticians together in one
center. It would have both made access to analytic engagement unduly painful and
unheathfully constrained the development of statisticians. I think that the most
effective all-around configuration is to mix data scientists with other
professionals so that there are other data scientists nearby and all data
science practitioners in a division, say, regularly interact with each other to
work through problems together and to learn.</p>

<div id="assessing-data-science-capacity" class="section level4" number="5.4.2.2">
<h4>
<span class="header-section-number">5.4.2.2</span> Assessing data science capacity<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessing-data-science-capacity"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h4>
<p>CDC’s ability as an agency to do data science depends on all the cultural
components that I have listed above: intentional cultivation of learners as well
as constructive support and direction for data science practitioners and experts
that not only respects but also appeals to their know-how and their drive—both
their technical skill and their nontechnical skills. An assessment of data
science capacity needs to include, and go beyond, characterizing the aggregate
set of those technical and nontechnical skills. It is important also to discern
from people who do good things with data what they need and what they want in
order both to continue and to improve. Let’s break those ideas down by focusing
on people who do data science (practitioners and experts) and people who
directly empower, enable, or support them (managers). Because we are in the
federal system, we will also need to distinguish federal staff, (nonfederal)
learners, and other nonfederal staff. Finally, we want to characterize
individual data science competencies as well as unit-level competencies at
increasing levels of aggregation, such as teams, branches (collections of
teams), and so on.</p>
<p>For staff who do data science, we want to know their proficiency and aptitude
with technical skills in data analysis and computation as they apply across the
life cycle of data. In my experience, the most effective way to discern
technical and nontechnical skills and aptitude is for experts to see the skills
in action, either prospectively or retrospectively: How well can the
practitioner frame a problem? Work out what kind of data address the problem?
Arrange, explore, and analyze the data using suitable tools? Correctly describe
and critique the analysis? Demonstrate critical reflection throughout? Keep the
activity directed toward the ultimate goal and deal with obstacles by acting on
traits such as curiosity, attentiveness, perseverance, open-mindedness, and
creativity? In addition to this broad set of competencies, we also want to know
about particular strengths, for example, with programming in Python or deep
learning or time series, as well as areas that warrant learning in order to
address intended data science tasks. No one staff person needs to master all the
technical skills, but they should have sufficient acumen to discern where their
skills apply and where they do not.</p>
<p>For staff who supervise data science practitioners or lead projects that apply
data science, we need to assess and edify their data fluency, sufficient to
guide and empower practitioners and experts. Data fluency includes the ability
to understand the components of the life cycle of data, how those components
relate to each other, the skills that each core activity calls for, and the
intellectual traits and practices that support critical reflection and
adaptation throughout the life cycle. Managers could be, but do not need to be,
data science practitioners or experts. Where a manager lacks expertise, they
will need the humility and wisdom to turn to experts. Furthermore, managers
should demonstrate the skills needed to foster both learning and mentoring.</p>
<p>Some staff enable data science but do not practice it or manage those who
practice it, such as information technologists or cloud engineers. For these
staff, we also need to assess and edify their data fluency and their
understanding of the life cycle of data, centered on analysis.</p>
<p>Data science is interdisciplinary. To ensure domain knowledge in addition to
computational and data-analytic skills, we need to account for the combined set
of skills and knowledge as groups of staff roll up into teams and other
aggregated units. <em>And</em> we need to consider additional nontechnical skills for
collaboration and negotiation. When considering a collection of staff and their
joint mission, what are the specific strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in their
collective ability to prepare, conduct, and communicate analysis? Do they have
special strength or notable weakness in areas that could affect their ability to
meet their mission, such as detailed knowledge of longitudinal claims data or
time series methods? Assessment of larger units could especially call for
evaluative expertise from outside the unit, as practitioners and managers might
not be able to identify their own gaps.</p>
<p>A capacity assessment extends beyond individual and collective skills and
traits, however. What do incumbent staff think that they <em>need</em> in order to do
data science well and to keep doing it better? What do incumbent staff <em>want</em> in
order to do data science well and to keep doing it better? Taking staff
interests seriously can nurture morale and foster staff retention, but it also
recognizes that staff are often the experts on supporting and bolstering their
own capacity. Just as modernization should pay due heed to early-career
professionals (the epitome of modern), and world-class analytics should pay due
heed to data science practitioners and experts (the epitome of data-savvy), an
assessment of data science capacity should pay due heed to the staff who
actually do things with data. And yet these staff are often overlooked when they
should be intentionally and directly engaged. Enlightened organizations often
conduct exit interviews with departing staff, in part as an after-action
analysis of the counterfactual: Now that you’re leaving, under what conditions
might you have stayed? In a progressive culture for data, practicing staff are
continuously seen as partners, or even experts, in knowing how their unit can
best function to keep up with fast-moving methods, tools, and technology. The
culture, through supervisors and other governance, should continually engage
with data-oriented practitioners proactively throughout their tenure, to empower
them, facilitate their ongoing achievement, assure forward-looking resources,
direct their efforts, and hold them to account.</p>

</h4>
<p>Assessment lets us know where we are and a little bit about how prepared we are
to move in the directions that we want to go. But how do we shape and develop
that capacity to do good things with data? This section outlines a way to
structure the mission and focus of data science practice using 3 organizing
rubrics predicated on concepts presented earlier in this essay. Those rubrics
then translate into organizing principles, which lead to specific practices.</p>
<p>The 3 rubrics encompass (1) the core activities of the practice of data science,
(2) the prepositional calculus of learning through data, and (3) a primary but
fluid commitment to specific topics and services within the unit’s mission.</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 1: Core activities of the practice of data science</strong>. Data science
intentionally connects all core data science activities across the life cycle of
data, as explained above, together with critical reflection at each core
activity.</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 2: Modes of learning through data</strong>. We use data to learn about the
world in at least 3 ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Learn about data, to understand the kinds of questions they might be used to
answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn from data, in support of answering questions put to the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn with data, by using data to develop, explore, or evaluate methods.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This prepositional calculus distinguishes assessing quality and utility from
making inferences, which are in turn distinguished from a focus on methods
themselves for learning about or from data.</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 3: Topical goods and services</strong>. The third rubric distinguishes the
goods or services delivered as a result of engaging with the life cycle of data.
Under this rubric, technical assistance to collaborating partners is an
essential service, as are developing methods for ensuring data validity,
evaluating case definitions, and collaborative analysis of population health.</p>
<p>We translate these 3 rubrics into organizing principles by linking them to data
science activities.</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 1 → Principle 1</strong>. Link all data science activities to 1 or more of the core activities of the practice of data science, in the context and awareness of the other core activities. A team’s primary skills and products should be organized around performing these core activities, with explicit notice of the scientific or business question of interest, the source(s) and transformation of data, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 2 → Principle 2</strong>. Link all data science activities to 1 or more of the learning prepositions. Is the purpose of a given activity to understand the structure and attributes of some data source (learn about), to make claims about the world such as trends in asthma (learn from), or to get better at carrying out one or both of those purposes (learn with)?</p>
<p><strong>Rubric 3 → Principle 3</strong>. Identify data science activities as subject-matter inquiry, service, or both. Establish the value and priority of each of these purposes.</p>
<p>Bringing it all together, data science capacity, and the skills to support and
expand that capacity, should be linked directly to priority tasks and interests,
which in turn are tied to core activities, “prepositional calculus”, and inquiry
vs service.</p>
<p>Finally, identify put these principles in practice, as with the following
examples:</p>
<p>Consider a team that focuses primarily on applying data science to the practice
of syndromic surveillance. The team carries out tasks primarily related to data
engineering (learning about data) and to supporting routine analysis of
emergency department data (learning from data) for surveilling opioid overdose,
hurricane-related morbidity, heat-related illness, Covid-19, and other
conditions of public health interest. Although the team’s work covers all the
core activities of data science, they focus primarily on the activities
concerning obtaining, exploring, and analyzing data.</p>
<p>Example 1 (about). Among the list of proposed and actual activities directed to
assessing or assuring data quality and utility, establish relative priorities
and contingencies. These activities include at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop, automate, routinize, and integrate measures of the health of data
feeds, which in turn include characteristics such as completeness,
timeliness, conformance to standards, and fitness for purpose; products
include regular reports, on-demand reports, and summary dashboards.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess value and limitations of data content, such as demographic data as
received or as imputed.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess mechanics and quality of auxiliary data sources, including laboratory
and vital records.</p></li>
<li><p>Assess mechanics and quality of using more than 1 data source for ecological
analysis, such as merging at ZIP Code or county level, then aggregating
post-fusion analytic results.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example 2 (from). Among the list of proposed and actual activities directed to
addressing specific, descriptive public health inquiry, establish relative
priorities and contingencies. These activities include at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Measure coverage and representativeness with methods and results that pass
peer review.</p></li>
<li><p>Characterize persons included in data sources, by demographic and (inferred)
clinical factors.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop and evaluate methods for monitoring specific conditions, integrating
external knowledge of the epidemiology of those conditions, to detect
temporal anomalies in a way that balances the utility of automated signals
with the effort to attend to those signals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Example 3 (with).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Document methods for processing and learning about data sufficient to
motivate independent re-implementation, in the interest of transparency,
reproducibility, and intellectual credit.</p></li>
<li><p>Advance the ability to process and use data from multiple sources.</p></li>
<li><p>Advance the ability to develop data queries with a focus on conditions of
interest, going beyond matching substrings by including machine-assisted
record retrieval and semantic analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Advance the ability to incorporate temporal and spatial information for
detecting anomalies, focused on specific conditions and jurisdictions of
interest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This framework for shaping and developing data science capacity does not
independently invoke learning, because learning is an essential defining
characteristic of a progressive culture for data. Rather, this framework orients
learning toward the rubrics, principles, and practices of doing data science,
both to prepare to do data science and to do it. In a truly progressive culture,
learning that is not specifically oriented to a product or service can still
serve an essential good, because it prepares the mind to see possibility and,
one hopes, to keep up with it. Louis Pasteur said, “In the field of observation,
chance favors only the prepared mind.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-pasteur_discours_nodate">Pasteur and Vallery-Radot</a>)</span></p>

</h2>
<p>Data science practitioners and experts—learners and doers—should lead CDC
and ATSDR into the modern era through learning and advocacy. In a progressive
culture for data, leadership is part of the practice of data science, and not
separate from it. Leaders include practitioners, experts, managers, and
laypersons, regardless of their career stage, job title or series, credential,
or location in the hierarchy. Practitioners and experts, in particular, must
play a prominent, visible role in creating and leading a progressive culture for
data in public health. As professionals who engage directly with data, we should
ensure that the agency adopts, masters, and promotes an appropriately diverse
set of tools and mindsets for using data to solve problems by showing how to
learn from data and with data and by empowering others to do the same.
Leadership continually shapes and sustains the culture of good data practice. As
a community, we need to advocate to ensure that our interests and needs are
folded into modernization initiatives as the agency becomes better tuned to
meeting a modern mission. If learners and doers see leadership as separate from
the practice of data science, then we risk leaving ourselves out.</p>
<p>We should invest in and take pride in personal technical excellence in doing
good things with data—to construct, analyze, and interpret models of public
health or administrative outcomes. To lead, though, we need to go further than
technical excellence.</p>
<p>We should emphasize learning from data—unlocking meaning through analysis. We
need to be as practical and solutions-oriented as public health is. And we need
to be rigorous, to ensure that all data-analytic practices hold up to scrutiny,
even when there’s honest disagreement about methods or conclusions.</p>
<p>We should be principled pluralists on methodology. We see misapprehension about
imputation methods (“making up data”), Bayesian methods (“too subjective”), and
machine learning (“black box”, “data dredging”). But all these methods and more
can help us learn from data, as long as those tools are used wisely and well.
This is largely what Leo Breiman was saying in 2001 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-breiman_statistical_2001">Breiman 2001</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>And we should promote and praise good data-analytic practice, regardless of job
title, credentials, or occupational series. Everyone who wants to do good things
with data should have the intellectual support to do so, as long as they proceed
with rigor and stand behind their work. This is as true for sociologists and
microbiologists as it is for epidemiologists and statisticians.</p>
<p>We should provide leadership on how to integrate data science into
interdisciplinary efforts and put data science on equal footing with other
specialties. We need to be able to serve as an integral part of a team with
collaborators from other backgrounds or disciplines, to apply and translate
rigorous data science concepts for the benefit of collaborating scientists, and
to explore and respect the rigorous application of concepts from other domains
as part of collaborative undertakings. We must learn and practice methods for
interpreting complex concepts for nonspecialists, without unduly sacrificing
rigor.</p>
<p>That said, experts in data science are the foundation for good practice by
practitioners, helping them to use data-analytic tools wisely and well. In a
progressive culture for data, leadership aims toward and flows from practical
wisdom.</p>
<p>We should hold fast to solid norms in how we learn from data as a basis for
high-consequence decisions. The Covid-19 pandemic has been a time of high
pressure, fast movement, substantial uncertainty, intense collaboration, and
rapid turnover. It can be tempting, under these circumstances, to cut corners on
rigor—to try to get it done faster but to make concessions on quality. The
opposite is needed: During times like this, and Ebola, and EVALI, and other
high-consequence events, integrity is as important as ever. Data science
practitioners with varied expertise have shown that we can achieve both high
speed and high quality.</p>
<p>We should lead from every level. Front-line analysts lead by showing how modern
tools and methods help solve modern problems. Team leaders and branch chiefs
lead by fostering and rewarding curiosity, investing in learning (and not just
training), and encouraging the interesting mistakes that come with innovation.
Division and center leaders and associate directors help ensure that our
infrastructure—our people, processes, and technology—can support modern and
future tools and methods. In all of this, those who specialize in methodology
and analysis lead from wherever they are, so that everyone who wants to do good
things with data, can.</p>
