</h1>
<p>A progressive culture for data in public health keeps up with fast-moving
methods, tools, and technology for continuously learning things about the world
and empowering choices informed by those learnings. This declaration frames the
major elements for cultivating and sustaining this progressive culture and for
leading public health into the modern era. Public health scientists who care
about data can flourish in a culture that fosters technical skills, inspires and
rewards intellectual drive, and supports learners in community.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical skills include math and statistics, programming and data
structures, communications and visualization, and domain knowledge in public
health and allied fields.</p></li>
<li><p>Nontechnical skills put the traits of a good learner or knower into action,
motivating and enabling those who care about data to learn and to practice
wisely.</p></li>
<li><p>Support for empowering and doing good things with data comes from a
community of peers, mentors, and advocates centered on learning.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>A progressive culture for data in public health manifests the following
principles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data as object: A progressive culture for data is <strong>dedicated to learning
<em>from</em> data</strong>. In a progressive culture, data have value because they
mediate how we learn things about the world. Those learnings allow us to
make informed choices about how we interact with the world, for example,
through public health interventions.</p></li>
<li><p>Data as subject: A progressive culture for data is <strong>dedicated to learning
<em>about</em> data</strong>, because data come in many structures, sizes, shapes, and
speeds, from small, flat data tables to massive, unstructured data streams.
Data conform to a variety of standards, or no standards at all. The varied
characteristics and complexity of data both enrich and constrain the ways
that data reveal characteristics of the world.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Data as mediator: A progressive culture for data is <strong>dedicated to learning
<em>with</em> data</strong> through its full life cycle<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Items 3.1-3.5 are adapted from &lt;em&gt;The Art of Data Science&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>1</sup></a>, primarily
through knowing how analytic methods allow us</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>to pose rich questions about the world, amenable to rich methods;</p></li>
<li><p>to guide how we generate, transmit, obtain, and prepare data;</p></li>
<li><p>to probe data to answer questions about the world;</p></li>
<li><p>to place answers from data in context, mindful of assumptions and
alternatives;</p></li>
<li><p>to present data-driven answers to audiences clearly and correctly;</p></li>
<li><p>to preserve those answers and ensure that the entire life cycle is
transparent, accessible, traceable and, to the extent possible,
reproducible.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Community supports doing good things with data through 4 primary roles:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Learner-practitioners</strong> with basic or intermediate data skills come
from any discipline to do good things with data, mindful of the full
life cycle of data. In a progressive culture for data, everyone who
wants to do good things with data has the intellectual support to do so,
accepting that they must proceed with rigor and stand behind their work.
Practitioners learn continuously and show how modern tools and methods
solve modern problems.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Expert practitioners</strong> go deep on data science methods. Experts help
ensure that everyone who wants to do good things with data, can. They
set norms for the practice of data science and for learning from, about,
and with data. They enable, guide, correct, and empower practitioners to
proceed with rigor and stand behind their work.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Managers</strong> supervise practitioners and experts, to ensure that they
have the resources and direction that they need to achieve good things
with data, now and in the future. Managers foster and reward curiosity,
invest in learning (not just training), and encourage innovation and
interesting mistakes. They advocate for the means to enable
practitioners and experts to continue increasing their capability,
efficiency, and effectiveness. Managers hold practitioners and experts
to account for producing knowledge learned from, about, and with data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lay advocates</strong> work in community with practitioners, experts, and
managers as persons literate in the value of data to help learn things
about the world. Laypersons know how to assess, use, and advocate for
learning from data. They help ensure supportive resources to enable
learning.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Members of a progressive culture for data <strong>respect the fundamentals, value
innovation, and practice pragmatic, principled pluralism</strong>. Members apply
wisely and well all methods that can help them achieve technical excellence
to learn from, about, and with data. These methods include the classical,
conventional, and innovative; statistics and machine learning;
correlational, causal, and predictive inference; analysis, synthesis, and
forecasting. Principled pluralism allows honest disagreement about methods,
results, and interpretation.</p></li>
<li><p>A progressive culture for data in public health <strong>fosters public trust</strong>,
motivated by public service to conduct itself ethically, <strong>protect
privacy</strong>, and ensure that data and methods are <strong>radically open and
transparent</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>In a progressive culture for data, <strong>leadership is radically and
intentionally inclusive</strong>, continually shaping and sustaining the culture of
good data practice. Practitioners, experts, managers, and laypersons lead
from every level, regardless of their career stage, job title, credential,
or job series, so that everyone who wants to do good things with data, can.
In a progressive culture for data, governance enables effective leadership,
but governance does not substitute for leadership.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The public health sector faces constant challenges to stretch modest resources,
to anticipate and respond to threats, and to promote population health. A
progressive culture remains rooted in history and continues to learn from old
data in new ways, and it anticipates the future and handles evolving demands and
to keep up with fast-moving methods, tools, and technology. Cultivating a
progressive data culture in the present will best position the field of public
health as ever ready to learn from and act on data.</p>
