</h2>
<p>In January 2015, I started in CSELS as CDC’s first, and (for at least 7
years) only, Associate Director for Data Science (ADDS). NIH had an ADDS
by that time, and other CDC centers have had informatics or statistics
leads, and some now have data science leads. But the title ADDS remained
unique within CDC. I stepped into the role about 15 years after becoming
a CDC employee and about 30 years after I first started working with
data, statistics, and computing. In the role of CSELS ADDS, I tried to
make sense and nonsense of the term “data science”, thinking through
what data science is and is not, why it matters for CDC, and most
importantly how CDC can do public health better by doing data better.
Early on, my favorite framing became not the definitional “<em>What is</em>
data science?” but the cultural “<em>Who gets to do</em> data science?”</p>
<p>My personal values motivated me to pursue technical excellence and to
offer those skills in public service. I entered public health because I
wanted to use rigorous methods to help better the human condition. I am
a methodologist, trained in math, statistics, some philosophy, and a
smattering of other disciplines. I like to figure out how one can
measure and count what is observed and quantify uncertainty about what
remains beyond direct observation. Our culture perpetuates the notion
that, with the inevitable march of dispassionate science, humanity will
take the upper hand against what threatens or saddens us. How does a
scientist resolve the apparent discordance between values and the
cultural myth of dispassionate objectivity? We start by acknowledging
the tools and power of scientific inquiry, and we respect their role in
how we develop knowledge about the world. Values motivate and shape
scientific endeavors, and passion itself can fuel scientific pursuits.
None of us should shrink from or apologize for our commitment to the
mission of public health. Our stories from data necessarily express
perspectives and values; we have to commit to portraying and defending
those worldviews.</p>
<p>My mentoring experience is the single greatest influence on how I think
and talk about the values that can motivate and shape data science, as
well as the skills that undergird data science practice. Since early
2000, I’ve had the pleasure of mentoring dozens of early-career
scientists—post-doctoral fellows in the Epidemic Intelligence Service,
Prevention Effectiveness, Public Health Informatics, and the Oak Ridge
Institute for Science and Education (ORISE); undergraduate, master’s,
and doctoral students; all budding scholars and professionals in public
health, medicine, philosophy, physics, mathematics. Into each of these
relationships, I have poured a bit of myself and my respect for managing
data, for coaxing meaning from data, for delighting in discovery from
data, and for sharing stories from data with colleagues. Every one of
these mentoring relationships has changed me as a data scientist and
reinforced my belief that learners believe.</p>
<p>I came to believe 2 things about the practice and profession of data
science in my time at CDC: (1) Everyone who practices data science
should have the intellectual support to do so rigorously, whether a
statistician, epidemiologist, philosopher, or some other brand of
scholar. Rigorous practice entails standing behind your methods and
conclusions, which can be an intimidating duty when reaching beyond your
expertise. (2) Everyone who commits to doing data science as a
profession should accept the intellectual responsibility to contribute
their expertise, both collaborating with and leading scientists from
other disciplines. We have to commit ourselves to communicating clearly
with those who share our specialty and with those who don’t but who
respect the ways that our specialty bolsters and advances public health
research and practice.</p>

</h2>
<p>I’ve been practicing or professing data science one way or another for a
long time, typically under the title statistician or mathematical
statistician or methodologist. When I was 5 years old in first grade, I
thought that I might want to be a mathematician (or an artist or a
basketball player). In sixth grade, I got to play with an Apple II, with
its BASIC programming and 5.25-inch floppy diskettes. As an
undergraduate, I helped teach the obscure but powerful programming
language APL (literally “A Programming Language”) to high school
students. I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics in 1991 and
a Doctor of Philosophy degree in statistics in 1997.</p>
<p>In late 1997, about 2 months after filing my dissertation, I started
with CDC as a contractor in the Division of Reproductive Health (DRH). I
became a federal employee in early 2000, continuing to work in DRH,
mostly on cohorts and clinical trials, until late 2004. Then I spent
about 3 years overseeing CDC’s institutional review boards and thinking
about the connection between how we justify research risk and how we
learn from data.</p>
<p>I served from mid-2007 through early 2015 in the Division of
Tuberculosis Elimination (DTBE), working largely on clinical trials and
creative but rigorous ways to get better at finding TB to stop TB. While
in DTBE, I became a self-appointed evangelist for the R statistical
computing environment. In 2012, I articulated a vision for leadership in
mathematical sciences, which included skills specifically in technical
excellence and clear communication—the seeds of my belief in
leadership in a progressive culture for data. In March 2014, I spoke on
“A Scrappy Little Division That Cares a Lot About Data: A Vision for
Data Sciences in DTBE”. That presentation included my first use and
definition of the phrase “data science[s]”, with particular attention
to “data science tasks: end to end”, later called the data life cycle.</p>
<p>In August 2015, shortly after I started as CSELS ADDS, I brainstormed
dozens of potential topics for an internal CDC blog to explain and
promote data science, called “expression(data, science)”. I wrote the
blog title as if it were in a fictitious programming language, monospace
font and all: "expression(data, science)". The blog never really
happened. This essay revives many of the topics that I had brainstormed.</p>
<p>In November and December 2015, I presented "The Art of Data Science:
The Intense Pragmatism of Data in the Service of Public Health" at the
EIS fall course. I told the story of data science through real-life
experiences of 9 EIS fellows whom I had mentored. Although none of those
fellows had had a background specifically focused on data analysis, many
of them achieved great things with data, and others made interesting
mistakes worth learning from.</p>
<p>In May 2016, 14 months into my tenure as CSELS ADDS, I delivered a CSELS
science seminar entitled “Data Science and Data Wisdom: Cultivating a
Data Generation” (a pun on "generating data"; maybe I should let up on
the puns), in which I laid out the cultural components to support the
practice of data science. That presentation has evolved over the past
few years to become “Who Gets to do Data Science? A Progressive Culture
for Data in Public Health”, placing data science in the context of
related but distinct disciplines and emphasizing who does data science
more than what is data science.</p>
<p>In my latter days in CSELS, I turned my attention largely to machine
learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). We should regard ML as
extending the set of data-analytic tools available to us, and we should
use those tools where they help us learn things about the
world—including potentially better ways to do public health
surveillance and to adapt flexible and powerful ways to find disease and
improve health. ML, and its scalable applications through AI, should not
be mysterious or intimidating, and these tools should not be regarded as
any more magical than familiar methods. Moreover, they should be subject
to the same critical reflection and norms as other methods for
scientific inquiry. Current agency discussion about the potential for ML
and AI risks focusing too narrowly on technology and not enough on
learning from data in ways that aim for scientific quality and rigor, as
discussed at length in the sections <a href="what.html#what-is">3.1</a> and <a href="what.html#what-is-not">3.2</a> above: from posing
questions of social value and scientific validity through ensuring that
conclusions are traceable and defensible, that reasoning is coherent,
and that the whole process is neutral, subject to minimal subjective
bias, rigorous, transparent, reproducible, and so on. I expand further
on ML and AI in section <a href="ml-ai.html#ml-ai">8</a>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> Why a progressive culture?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#why-a-progressive-culture"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>By the end of 2016, when I had been the CSELS ADDS for almost 2 years,
CDC's Surveillance Strategy had successfully led to demonstrable
improvements in technology for mortality, case-based surveillance,
syndromic surveillance, and laboratory-based surveillance. Early
formative efforts for a nascent Public Health Data Strategy in 2018
tapped dozens of midcareer and senior leaders to shape next-phase
modernization. From those early days, I lodged 2 substantive concerns:
(1) Regarding data, staff who work directly with public health data
should join in co-leading the nascent data strategy because they know
first-hand the challenges that they have in getting things done with
data. (2) Regarding modernization, early-career staff should also join
in co-leading the modernization effort, because they are more likely to
have an essentially modern take on data and progress than mid- and
late-career leaders alone. In August 2018, I nominated a “data science
breakfast club”—an interdisciplinary collection of a dozen
early-career data science practitioners—to discuss their experiences
doing data science at CDC and how CDC could effectively develop a data
science-savvy workforce. By early 2019, neither concern about data
leadership and modernization leadership had gained appreciable traction,
and the breakfast club never convened. I was told that the “movement"
was open to early-career and data-involved staff, but it became clear
that the movement would not engage them intentionally on their terms,
for their co-leadership.</p>
<p>The strategy also struggled to describe <em>why</em> it was important to do
data better. The emerging federal data strategy acknowledged the
importance of data as an asset. And both the federal level and agency
level connected that asset to informed decision-making and action. But
neither the federal level nor the agency level explicitly articulated in
what sense data were an asset and in what way data could inform
decisions and action. I developed and shared a metaphor that we were
conceiving of data as a treasure, and we were coming to acknowledge that
we were largely hoarding that treasure, as if in a cave. Like the
treasure in a cave, data are an asset because they have value, but we
realize that value only when we <em>use</em> or <em>spend</em> rather than store the
data. <strong>Data have value because we use data to learn things about the
world and to do things with what we learn, including but not limited to
making decisions and taking action.</strong> Data have value because we use
them to build things, like artificial intelligence tools, that promise
to help us interact with the world more efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>I became disheartened by what I perceived as regressive blinders.
Despite my pessimism, I still believed that the intentions of the
emerging strategy were largely sound. So I challenged myself to invert
my pessimism and asked, "What would it take for CDC to be
<em>progressive</em>?" About 3 months later, I had drafted a manifesto for a
progressive culture for data in public health, appended to this essay as
an appendx (<a href="declaration.html#declaration">A</a>).</p>
<p>In 2019, the Public Health Data Strategy merged with the concurrently
emerging Information Technology Modernization Strategy to become the
Public Health Modernization Initiative and eventually the Data
Modernization Initiative (DMI). In August 2019, as the Surveillance Data
Platform was wrapping up its work, a presentation on the merged
modernization initiative enumerated 5 pillars for a modernization
strategy. Despite the strategy’s stated intent to develop “world-class
analytics”, nothing in the pillars addressed the role of analysis. When
I pointed this out, I was told that it was implicit in all 5 pillars. A
value that is not explicitly stated risks getting ignored. With DMI came
initial political success in the form of $50 million in appropriation
to seed the effort, fleeting moments before the Covid-19 pandemic pushed
modernization efforts and funding into overdrive. DMI and concurrent
investments have prepared the public health sector to advance more
rapidly in response to the pandemic than ever expected. Nonetheless, DMI
remained slow to engage data practitioners and early-career
professionals as leaders in this data revolution. Thus, the manifesto
still complements DMI as a vision for realizing the value of data as an
asset in a culture centered on the roles of data practitioners and
experts, learners and doers.</p>
<p>That manifesto is now an organizing principle for this essay. In the
manifesto, I state, “a progressive culture remains rooted in history and
continues to learn from old data in new ways.” This collection is itself
rooted in a personal history.</p>
